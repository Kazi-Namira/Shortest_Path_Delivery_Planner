# **Shortest Path Delivery Planner** 

**Shortest Path Delivery Planner** is an interactive application that calculates and visualizes the shortest path between two locations using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**. Built with **C++** and **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library), this project allows users to interact with a graphical map, select nodes, and see the real-time animation of a car following the shortest route.

## **ðŸŒŸ Features**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Efficiently calculates the shortest path between two nodes.
- **Interactive UI**: Select source and destination nodes directly on the graphical map.
- **Graphical Visualization**:
  - Nodes are represented with easily identifiable icons.
  - Edges connect nodes, displaying their respective weights.
  - The shortest path is highlighted in **green** for easy identification.
- **Real-Time Animation**: Watch a car follow the calculated shortest path, providing a dynamic and engaging representation of the solution.

## **ðŸ”§ How It Works**
1. **Input**:
   - The user provides the number of vertices and edges.
   - The user specifies the connections between nodes and their respective weights.
   - Node positions are set on the map, allowing for an interactive experience.
2. **Shortest Path Calculation**:
   - The program uses **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to determine the shortest path between the selected source and destination nodes.
3. **Rendering**:
   - **SFML** is used to render the map, nodes, edges, and animations, offering smooth graphics and an engaging interface.
4. **Real-Time Animation**:
   - The car icon animates along the shortest path, providing a real-time visualization of the route.

## **ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step Guide**

### **1. SFML Setup**

Before running the project, you need to set up **SFML** for rendering graphics.

- **Follow this YouTube tutorial** to set up SFML on your machine:  
  [**SFML Setup Tutorial**](https://youtu.be/PJN5XlAUThU?si=6-oi2c1NhKtcEGdk)  

Make sure to follow the instructions for your specific platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) to correctly install and configure SFML.

### **2. Setting Up Assets and Code**

Before running the project, make sure you set up the **Assets/** and **Code/** folders with the necessary image files and code.

1. **Setting Up the Assets Folder**:
   - In the root directory of the project, create a folder named `Assets/`.
     [Explore Assets](./Assets)

2. **Setting Up the Code Folder**:
   - The **Code/** folder contains the main program file (`main.cpp`), where the core logic of the project resides.
   - You do **not** need to modify the `main.cpp` file unless you want to customize the logic or add new features.
      [Explore Code](./Code)

     
   - The **Makefile** is also located in the root directory, pre-configured to handle the compilation of the project.

Ensure that the files are named exactly as mentioned to avoid any issues during runtime. Once the assets and code are set up, you can proceed with compiling and running the project as described in the next section.
